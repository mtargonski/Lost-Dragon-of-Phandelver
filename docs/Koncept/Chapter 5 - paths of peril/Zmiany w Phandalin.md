So here's my list of Everything Phandalin should have in Chapter 2 but isn't mentioned there!

The Woodworker's is a crime scene from the murder of the woodcarver Thel Dendrar (Chapter 2, R8).
The  locations of the 4 obelisk fragments (Chapter 5, Stolen Shards) are at the
* Sleeping Giant embedded in the bar, 
* at the Phandalin Miners Exchange in the corner of the floor,
* at the Shrine of Luck as the capstone of the arch, 
* and the drum of Barthen's Well.
* 
The  Sleeping Giant has a second floor so that Grista can "climb  downstairs", a broom for chasing goblins, and a fireplace and chimney for goblins to climb up (Chapter 5, Sleeping Giant, Talking to Grista).

The Sleeping Giant has a cellar so that a sinkhole can appear in it (Chapter 7, The Fourth Infection)

The roof of the Sleeping Giant is shingle (Chapter 5, Goblin Mischief).

There is a bakery near the Stonehill Inn (Chapter 5, goblin Mischief).

Daisy the Cow (Chapter 6, Quest: The Odd Cow) is from outside of town but you might want to have her in town so the party can notice her before she's  transformed

There is also a bunch of NPC's go missing (Chapter 6, Missing NPC's):
