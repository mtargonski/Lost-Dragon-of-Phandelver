Finished reading Phandelver and Below. Here's my overview and thoughts on improvements...

I  read 10 of the official D&D campaign books, and I have run 6 of  them, though never Lost Mine of Phandelver. I have just finished reading  Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk and I like it!
The  campaign is linear with very obvious story hooks. Some DM's will love  this as it's easy to run, others will feel railroaded. If Curse of  Strahd and Tomb of Annihilation are your favorite campaigns you may find  this confining. If you're new to DMing or lack prep time, this is  definitely a great campaign to run.
It  doesn't have the big epic reveals of Descent into Avernus or Out of the  Abyss, it's more of a slow burn building horror. I love that it is  linked to a place that evolves over the course of the campaign. It is  very important that your players love Phandalin and want to protect it  and it's people, because that is what makes the campaign's threats have  stakes.
There's a lot of dungeon  crawls in Phandelver and Below and some of them are very linear, but  they typically have their own little stories of what's happening in the  dungeon or why it is the way it is which I enjoy. There's heaps of maps  for everything, it's very well covered (though I'm still making a big  evolving town map and lots of random encounter maps).
Overall  the campaign is quite good at detailing what creatures care about so  that players can approach them with conversation if they are so  inclined.
Many published campaigns  have big structural issues, this isn't one of them. There's some  improvements I'm going to suggest below but none of these issues I'm  about to point out break the campaign, they are adjustments for a better  game. I'd love to hear your own thoughts on modifying the campaign.


These are the things I'd change on first reading:
Spoiler alert!
1. Reward  the characters with things in or around Phandalin so that they are  invested in it. The manor, mining claims, the forge of spells,  contracts, faction affiliations, relationships with NPC's. Make them  care!
2. There is no real link between the first half of the campaign and the second.
Connect  the Cragmaw goblins more strongly to the Sawplee goblins, e.g. a goblin  flunky that escapes the players at Cragmore Castle could be the leader  that they encounter later in Chapter 5. I'd have several goblins attempt  to flee or bargain with the party and make the most interesting one be  Ruxithid (chapter 5 villain).
Connect  Nezznar to either the drow in chapter 6 or have him opposing the Mind  Flayer plot e.g. maybe he lived at Gibbet Crossing before it fell and  now seeks the Forge of Spells to forge a weapon or tool to thwart their  plot. The players could find his vague notes as foreshadowing of later  chapters.
Foreshadow  the 4 obelisk fragments that are already in town present at Barthen's  Well, Shrine of Luck, Sleeping Giant, and Phandalin Miner's Exchange.  Descriptions of these objects are in Chapter 5.
3. The  cool Forge of Spells in Wave Echo Cave, the objective of the first half  of the adventure...doesn't do much. It needs to be a tool the players  can use to save the day in the second half. They're running around  collecting obelisk fragments anyway, perhaps those can be forged into  something cool and dangerous.
4. Chapters  5 to 8 lack a backstory for the obelisk. There's no explanation of why  the fragments are scattered about as they are. I haven't yet come up  with a good one but it will probably involve the Duergar who built the  dungeons in chapter 6, as they are keepers of secrets.
5. Chapter  6 is set up as a race to collect 3 fragments: "The characters must race  against the clock to keep the Mind Flayers and their lackeys from  recovering more of the shattered obelisk." Great idea but the campaign  doesn't set up or even foreshadow that race. Qunbraxel (chapter 6  villain) needs to be foreshadowed in Chapter 5 (e.g. one of his Grimlock  servants is there) and needs to show up in chapter 6 racing against the  party instead of hanging out in a room at the end of one of three  dungeons. This race has an impact on chapter 8, it needs to happen.
6. I would change the formulas on the map at G24 to show the percentage of  Phandalin's towns people that are transformed depending on how many  obelisk fragments are recovered, from 0 to 7. Make it clear that no  matter how successful the party has been in the race, the ritual will  happen and is still a threat.
7. The  transition from Chapter 6 to 7 is very heavy handed, the players could  very easily use the map and passages at Gibbet Crossing to explore the  underdark and find Illithinoch that way. I'd drop the tunnel from under  The Sleeping Giant, disregard the large scale part of the Tunnels of the  Deep map as it is functionally a straight line, and make this a more of  an open exploration of the underdark. Make it a hex crawl or point  crawl.
8. Chapter 7 Illithinoch has  an infected eldar brain that tracks the party through the dungeon, but  doesn't deliver anything with that. I would have the occupants of  Illithinoch avoid combat in favor of speaking with the players, with  each new being the party meets already knowing what they have said to  the others. They all slowly gather and prepare an ambush in X15. To  balance the odds Oshundo (X7) might warn or even aid the characters with  the goal of taking control of Illithinoch and purging the infected  brain.
9. Chapter 7 Spawn Hollow has a  cool effect where the floor and walls move slowly from S2 to S3, but  it's too slow to notice which totally spoils it. I'd speed it up to 10ft  per round so that it is observable and impacts combat.
10. In Chapter 8 I don't like that the final boss turns up after his plan has  been thwarted, I'd rather use him as a second wave of the final battle.


Character hooks:
Protecting  the people of Phandalin is central to the campaign. e.g. characters  should live there, want to live there, have family there, etc.
Ancient fallen kingdoms of Dwarfs, Duergar, Svifneblin, and Drow.
The god Dumathoin, Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain.
Magical secrets lost to time. Being an enemy of Goblins or Mind Flayers.
Horrible transformation of mind, body, and/or soul.
The Far Realms aka Lovecraftian horrors.
