Wand, uncommon (requires attunement)

This wand has 13 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend one charge to cast the Eldritch Blast spell. Make a ranged attack roll using your Charisma modifier and proficiency bonus against the target. 
On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

The wand can create more than one beam when attuned to a spellcaster: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam. Each additional beam expends an additional charge.

The wand regains 2d6+1 expended charges daily at sunset. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
