And here we go!

First of all it is important to remark that Hanun Kost is a red wizard of Thay, an evil wizard according to its stats. It is true that PCs can know this information just with a perception or history checks ( RAWly speaking) but Hanun can tell them a bit more about Thay, Szass Tam or even Netheril, depending on the approach of the characters. ( If you are using pregens characters the wizard should be more than interested in this lore, apart from that he maybe can tell about Netheril power in magic items ( giving a hint of his recent discovery: the protection ring [maybe the pregen rogue wants to take it, maybe the pregen wizard].

As a wizard I think he can give good advise about killing a dragon [Thundertree mission] or he can identify magic items [if there is no wizard in the party]. He, as previously mentioned, can tell about the forge of spells and maybe its function [observer's room from the Wave Echo Cave]. He is not very interested in Phandalin, but maybe it is in its surroundings. Think that this year a presumable following campaign will appear that has to do with obelisks, maybe it is this tower the detonant of it... Hanun can give hints about the Obelisks if you plan to continue with this story in the future.

Finally let me give you a little piece of advice. He is an evil Wizard, not hostile, but with an evil alignment. Try to roleplay him like that, thus maybe players are tempted to fulfill his mission [ask Agatha about the name of the constructor of the tower] in a false way, this is trying to deceive him. He must be a bit ahead of them, give him a read thoughts spell and do not give your players any reward until he can prove what they say was real.







He is a Red Wizard. Give them information on a new quest that will lead the the Thay. Or you could follow something like the new D&D movie, where it leads to a plot within Neverwinter concerning the Red Wizxards. I try to make most PNCs have a quest thread the PCs can follow if they want. You don't have to have all the answers, just a loose thread:
"My friends, I am merely here to find something to help my people. The people of my land are in dire need of help. With all the heroes that wander the coast, few will make the journey to the my land. We are under the iron rule of a tyrannt who cares little for the masses. Now, my child has been taken by the Red Wizards for training. But few children survive the trials. I know its a loss cause, but what kind of father would I be if I didn't try to bring her home? Sorry, I don't mean to trouble you. I'm sure you have your own troubles. *sigh*"
