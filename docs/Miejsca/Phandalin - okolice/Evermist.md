## The Hamlet of Evermist 
Evermist is a grain depot and rest stop for High Road travelers. Crops from eastern farmlands are processed here for delivery to Neverwinter. The hamlet sits on the east side of the road and consists of an inn, a general store, a smithy, and a granary. On the west side of the road a palisade
surrounds an ancient stone watchtower, which the hamlet relies upon for protection. All residents are human.

### Dewdrop Inn
Burned to the ground and still smoking, the inn is a total loss.

### Evermist Sundry
The general store is awaiting resupply. For any particular item on the Adventuring Gear table, roll a 1d4 to determine availability. A roll of 1 indicates the item is out of stock.
The merchant behind the counter, [Theos Wittram], is a slender, grey-haired old man with a muttonchop mustache.
He can provide the following information to the party:

> Evermist has been attacked in darkness three times since the new moon. The first two attacks were repulsed by the watchtower garrison. The latest attack happened during godswake (predawn) this very day, leaving the inn sacked and the blacksmith's daughter carried off. One of the garrison soldiers was killed in the fighting. After salvaging what they could, the innkeeper and his family departed for Neverwinter this elsun (late morning).

### Noble Forge
The smithy is larger than average and includes a stables. There are living quarters in the back. The blacksmith, [Ferrus Stryker], is a muscular man about 40 years old with a full, dark beard. He will  quote 5 copper pieces to reshoe the ox but otherwise speak little. If anyone mentions his daughter, he will begin to weep.

Read the following text before the party leaves the smithy:
> A young woman bursts in and rushes to the blacksmith. 
> Clearly distraught, she begins pleading with him in a hushed voice, gesturing in your direction. The blacksmith shakes his head and growls, 
> 
> "We half nae riches tuh offer an' she's certain kilt benow!" 
> "Nie mam przeca niczego by dać, a znia to już pewno jedno się stało"
> 
> Frustrated, the woman turns to you, clasps her hands together and pleads, 
> 
> "Please find our little girl!"
> 
After apologizing for being bold and then introducing herself as Ferrus' wife, Margot will blurt out the following:

> Their daughter was taken by goblins twelve hours ago; she is seven years old and her name is [Remi].
The commander of the watchtower garrison is offering a bounty on goblins.

Margot will make every effort to convince the party to find and bring back Remi, dead or alive.
If the party accepts the quest, Ferrus will offer to care for the oxen, keeping them and the wagon in his stables until the party returns.

### Watchtower
[Thorn] dowodzący temu przyczółkowi, opowie, że daja 5 SM za każde ucho goblina.
Po ostatniej napaści, nawet wyruszyli w pościg, co jest sprzeczne z janym rozkazem dowództwa aby bronic silosa, stacjonarnie. Jenak [Remi] była, jest lubiana w osadzie. Jeden z żołnieży został zabity, reszta goblinów uciekła w las.
